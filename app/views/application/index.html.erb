          <p>Nametag is my special tool to manage club/organization contact information <b>without relying on Gsheets & formulas.</b> Some of the features include:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Drill down on a contact (vs. line of a gsheet)</li>
                <li>Easy-to-use form for creating a contact</li>
                <li>Calculation of # of contacts per event</li>
                <li>Responsive design for phones</li>
                <li>Coming soon: import from spreadsheet</li>
                <li>Coming soon: dropdowns to filter contacts</li>
                <li>Coming soon: # of guests and # of staff & returnee info</li>
              </ul>
